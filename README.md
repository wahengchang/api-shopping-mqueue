# api-shopping-mqueue
This is an example of implementing a flash sales API server, in lanaguage of Javascfript (Node.js). 

To support the requirement of 5000/s flash sales items , the system is designed for `Single Write, Multiple Read`, to avoid concurrency problems of updating `product quantity` , `user balance` and completing `transation`.

## To Optimize:
 - JSON validation for both input,output: API / Controller
 - Dynamic number for consumer, Ex, 10 workers for 5000 purchases tasks, / 1 worker for less than 50 purchases tasks.
 - limit, offset for pagination
